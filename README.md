# Dice-Game
Project in C

The Dice-Game Project was made to test my ability to use structures and ability to write and read from files.
In this game the User has optioons to add to their balance,play game, view top 5 players by balance, view top 5 players by winnings,
and exit the game. When adding to balance this program check if the user is from the file or not. If not then the program will tell the user this person is not registered.
Play game is where the fun starts with the user tapping the space bar to roll dice and if the user rolls 7 or their point value they win the game.
Point value is the number the user rolls on first attempt. Once user wins or loses they earn 10 points or lose points. After that the user gets the option to play again or no.
After. When the user exits game they are prompted with an exit message and the program writes to file the new balances after playing the game.
